# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 


## Discription

- this is sets of tasks as part of the AiCore project in my Data Eng9ineering course.

- this is a game that takes only one letter and return in the that letter is one on the options in the game, once the player get all the letter of the word they will win. 

- there is only 6 attempts to guess the word.

- there is no need to input the letter twice and if you do you will get a message that you already had that.

## File structure of the project

the files 1 to 3 are just build up to file 4 and 5, do there is some redundancy between the files

1. milestone_1.py: this file takes an input and ckeck if it is a single alphabetical. In addition, it chooses one random value from the list
1. milestone_2.py: this file takes an input and ckeck if it is a single alphabetical in a loop. In addition, it chooses one random value from the list and check weather the input value from the list or not. Both applied in separated functions.
1. milestone_3.py: this file encapsulate them in functions
1. milestone_4.py: this file construct the previous fuctions in a class Hangman with enhanced guess the check to see if the letter is there.
1. milestone_5.py: this file import file 4 and call and incetance of the class to run it in the function play_game that we use to play.
